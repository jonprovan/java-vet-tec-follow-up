		/*
		 * final has three meanings, depending on where it's used
		 * 
		 * for a property (final int x, etc.) -- it means the value CANNOT be changed once initialized -- it's a constant
		 * 		-- it CAN be declared and then initialized later, but once initialized, that's it
		 * 
		 * for a method (final void test(), etc.) -- it means it CANNOT be overridden in a child class (or any descendant)
		 * 		-- this doesn't work for abstract methods, of course
		 * 
		 * for a class (final class Machine, etc.) -- it means the class CANNOT be extended; nothing can inherit from it
		 * 		-- this doesn't work for abstract classes/interfaces
